# Automated Improved Dominions Starts
## An open-source map generator for Dominions 5

### How to use

1. Run the program.
2. In the main menu you'll see a list of players on the left. Choose a player count and select which nations will be used.
3. Click the generate button. Depending on the player count the generation process could take up to 3 minutes.
4. Once the map is generated, you can move the camera around by clicking and dragging.
5. Right click a province node or connection node to open the editor panel for that node.
6. Once you are happy with the map, click the export button. Maps are exported to the data folder.

### The to-do list

Missing features and other issues.

- Improve map generation speed.
- More sprite variety. Every type of sprite (ie. trees, mountains) should have, at the very least, 5 variants.
- Add unique sprites for hot and cold province modifiers. For example, a swamp with the colder province attribute should have some sort of unique sprite. Right now only wastelands are given hot/cold modifiers.

### The wish list

Some features that would be nice to have.

- Add a dialog box somewhere that lets players give provinces custom names if they want.
- Support for non-wrapping maps.
